README

This is a simple app called The Great Phone Book created in Ruby 2.1.1. If you want to search for a name or phone number then this app is for you! It will allow you to add contacts, list your contacts, and then search your contacts. It's like an address book from the future.

Setup:
In your terminal inside this project folder:

	gem install bundle

	bundle

	ruby app.rb
	 
	Go to http://localhost:4000 in your browser
	
	And theoretically...you should now be able to use The Great Phone Book!


Known bugs as of 2/5/15:
None at this time.

Note to my future self: It may have taken you far more hours than you ever thought possible, but you have finished the basics of The Great Phone Book! Congratulations! You should remember that thing you learned about how the save method might need to get it's own line so that you aren't infinitely adding objects to your array. You spent at least 5 hours today not realizing that. Now go forth and enjoy the evening because tomorrow we are going to clean up Assessment Three.
