README

This is a simple app called The Great Phone Book created in Ruby 2.1.1. If you want to search for a name or phone number then this app is for you! It will allow you to add contacts, list your contacts, and then search your contacts. It's like an address book from the future.

Setup:
In your terminal inside this project folder:

	gem install bundle

	bundle

	ruby app.rb
	 
	Go to http://localhost:4000 in your browser
	
	And theoretically...you should now be able to use The Great Phone Book!
